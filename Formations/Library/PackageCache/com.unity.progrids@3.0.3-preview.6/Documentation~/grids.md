# Set Grid Planes

These buttons allow you to control where the grid appears relative to the X, Y, and Z axes.

![Grid views](images/gridViews.png) 

![X grid plane](images/icons/grid-x.png) Use this to set the grid to render on the **X** axis (facing to the left/right).

![Y grid plane](images/icons/grid-y.png) Use this to set the grid to render on the **Y** axis (facing up/down).

![Z grid plane](images/icons/grid-z.png) Use this to set the grid to render on the **Z** axis (facing forwards/backwards).

![3D grid planes](images/icons/perspective.png) Use this to render a grid with all 3 axes.



> **TIP**: You can also enable the **Predictive Grid** option on the [Snap Settings](snapping.md) window if you want ProGrids to decide which grid plane to use.
